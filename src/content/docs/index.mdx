## About Aishwarya and Sahil

[Aishwarya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwarya-belle-991767145/), a professional lawyer both in the courtroom and in life, is set to marry [Sahil](https://sahilarora.in), a software engineer who cracks the dumbest jokes in the room. Somehow, Aishwarya found those funny, and here we are! Sahil still can't believe his luck, and he hopes to keep Aishwarya laughing for the rest of their lives.

Both Aishwarya and Sahil are very similar and very different at the same time. Both of them are very family-oriented while holding high individualistic standards. There is a very high chance you will find a bhajan ([the current one on our playlist](https://youtu.be/7ULuo-Xpfbk?si=FIIKH5Gdmk5uw3Ic)) as the last played song on their playlist. Both of them have a very, very bad clothing sense. Like very bad. Period.

Aishwarya doesn't care what she eats, but Sahil is very picky. Sahil is a very bad cook, while Aishwarya is a very good cook (nah, we are kidding). Sahil is a very bad dancer, while Aishwarya is amazing and steals Sahil's heart every time she dances to some tunes.

Well, we won't tell you everything here; it would just spoil the fun. You will have to come and see for yourself.

<Aside>
If you are reading this and you didn't get the invite, we are extremely sorry for not extending the invite. We wish we could have invited everyone, but we had to keep the guest list small. We hope you understand ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè.

We will definitely make up for it when we meet in person. We promise ü§ù.
