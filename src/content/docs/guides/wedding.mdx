We recommend taking the **return flight on 11th May, 2025** because the only direct flight to Delhi flies in the morning which conflicts with the event time.

<Aside title='Arrangements post checkout'>
Since this flight is post the checkout time of the venue, please let the hosts know if you are choosing this option to make sure we can make arrangements for overnight stay in Nashik accordingly
